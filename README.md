# Imprest

A react component library aimed at those who need a solid foundation of react components and view templates that scale with their projects' needs.

# Why is this project useful

Imprest offers a set of themable, reusable components following a rigid atomic design principle. It does so through the implementation of very specific views that are commonly used across many applications, as well as exposing it's foundational components so that users can implement their own more proprietory views.

# How do I get started

Imprest is not yet considered stable for use, for now take a look at the _work in progress_ documentation website.

Please consider [contributing](https://github.com/luk707/imprest/contribute) if this project could be of any interest or use to you!
